# Coframe Variant Builder Challenge

This repository contains the different variants of the website based on the Coframe Variant Builder Challenge.

## Overview
You were tasked with building various website variants using a set of requirements. Below are the details for each variant, which were created to improve, redesign, and customize the original website designs.

## Challenge Breakdown

### Variant A (Easy)
- **Task:** Change the headline from "Time is money. Save both." to a headline of your choosing.
- **Code:** `variant_A.js`
  - The headline has been updated to: **"Automate spend. Accelerate growth."**

### Variant B (Medium)
- **Task:** Add a "How It Works" section below the hero.
- **Code:** `variant_B.js`
  - A new section with a three-step process, including icons and descriptions, has been added to explain how the platform works.

### Variant C (Creative)
- **Task:** Create a variant of your choice.
- **Code:** `variant_C.js`
  - Redesigned the "Customer Stories" section to include a star rating system and reordered customer cards for a more engaging layout.

### Variant D (Medium)
- **Task:** Replace the main image with another image of your choosing, possibly using AI-generated images.
- **Code:** `variant_D.js`
  - The main image was replaced, and the layout had to be adjusted to accommodate the new image format. 
  - This variant also hides unnecessary sections to optimize the user experience.

### Variant E (Hard)
- **Task:** Add a key benefit bullets section underneath the headline with icons.
- **Code:** `variant_E.js`
  - A section has been added below the headline with key benefits for the product, featuring icons and concise descriptions.

### Variant F (Creative Vision)
- **Task:** Implement your own conversion idea.
- **Code:** `variant_F.js`
  - Redesigned the layout and optimized for mobile-first experience. Also, added animations and made the page more visually appealing to improve user engagement.
  - **Hypothesis:** The original MemoryAir site featured outdated visuals and static sections that made the layout feel cluttered. The redesign introduces a refreshed color scheme, modern typography, and carousel-based testimonial and logo sections to streamline space usage. This creates a cleaner, more contemporary feel while preserving brand trust and accessibility â€” ultimately improving visual clarity and perceived credibility.
